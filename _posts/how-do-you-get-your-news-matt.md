Meet Matt. 


&nbsp;

**1.How do you get&nbsp;your&nbsp;news? This is open-ended on purpose.&nbsp;**

I have an ongoing challenge with myself. &nbsp;I have read at least one newspaper every day since I was in 7th grade (1973). Regardless of where I am I try to read the local paper, usually the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. Wherever I am I track down the New York Times. #

I wake up to the BBC news on PBS then continue on to "Morning Edition" on WHYY in Philadelphia. &nbsp;After the first airing of "Morning Edition" I then tune into Howard Stern. &nbsp;Howard's take on the news is always insightful and sometimes very funny. &nbsp;During commercial breaks on Howard's show and after he goes of the air I switch over to WHYY in Philadelphia. &nbsp;Love listening to "Fresh Air" as a podcast and am always disappointed when I run out of &nbsp;my personal backlog of shows. &nbsp;I have added "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" to my must-watch &nbsp;list.

**2. Please send me a gif or video or poem that captures&nbsp;your&nbsp;attention span.**

I love this video because it demonstrates so many aspects of life that I believe we all wish we had--- connection to others, passion, and kindness. &nbsp;

**3. How do you take&nbsp;your&nbsp;coffee?** &nbsp;With cream &nbsp;please.

**4. Who's doing it right in&nbsp;news? &nbsp;**

I think PBS does a great job with "News Hour" and "Frontline." &nbsp;The New York Times is always a great read and where I look for national and international news. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

**5. What's the first&nbsp;news&nbsp;event that you remember?** &nbsp;I clearly remember my mother coming into my bedroom crying &nbsp;when I &nbsp;was 7 years old and telling me that Robert Kennedy had been killed. &nbsp;The following weekend the Philadelphia Inquirer or Bulletin printed a glossy photo of the senator. &nbsp;I hung it above my bed for months. &nbsp;When Martin Luther King was killed later in the year the scene repeated itself.

**6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?** My daughter Helen came home for Spring Break from Emerson College. &nbsp;Helen is in her junior year and it's wonderful to see her blossom into an independent thoughtful woman. &nbsp;

**7. Describe yourself a little bit. (For instance, if you are a professional knitter, tell me how you fell in love with knitting.)**

I spent decades in my hometown of Lansdowne, PA working to revitalize the community through the use of historic preservation. &nbsp;I've lead campaigns to restore the borough's 1902 railroad station and world war monuments, create a National Register Historic District, established a public park with a 400 year old sycamore as its centerpiece. &nbsp;Also wrote a book and produced a video about this historic community.

I'm the executive director of the Historic Lansdowne Theater Corporation, a non-profit corporation that owns the Lansdowne Theater an historic 1927 movie theater in my hometown of Lansdowne, PA. &nbsp;We are raising funds to restore and &nbsp;reopen &nbsp;this beautiful building as &nbsp;concert hall to accommodate adult alternative, classic rock, singer songwriters and local performing arts organizations. &nbsp;Here's a recent article about the project from the Philadelphia Inquirer [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150302\_Staging\_a\_comeback\_\_Inner-ring\_town\_counting\_on\_a\_theater.html](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20150302_Staging_a_comeback__Inner-ring_town_counting_on_a_theater.html)

&nbsp;

**8. May I use&nbsp;your&nbsp;real name? First and last? Twitter handle**?

Yes. Matt Schultz &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@lansdownemovie

**9. Where do you live? Region is fine. City is better, but optional.&nbsp;**

Lansdowne, PA (just west of Philadelphia)

**10. What do you absolutely hate about the&nbsp;news?**

I understand that the news and media is a form of entertainment and is driven by ratings and thereby money but…

I hate when entertainers present themselves as journalists and then impact the civic and political world. &nbsp;Entertainers such as Rush Limbaugh or Bill O'Reilly "stir the pot" so they can stand out from the crowd and pretend that they have great insight when in reality it's just a sideshow. &nbsp;Some politicians play to the viewers/listeners and come up with some harmful positions on important issues. &nbsp;

I hate when local newscasts spend time hyping television shows that will air later in the evening. &nbsp;That's not news and &nbsp;it diminishes the role of journalism in our society. &nbsp;I believe that remaining current with the local, national and international news is an important component of being a good citizen. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

**11. What's the best&nbsp;podcast&nbsp;or audio&nbsp;to listen to while doing chores?** &nbsp;I have a wide selection of podcasts that I listen to when I garden, or work on my house. &nbsp;I have long listened to Fresh Air, This American Life, The Moth , What I missed in History Class and TED Talks.

&nbsp;

**12. How do you get&nbsp;your&nbsp;news&nbsp;when you&nbsp;travel&nbsp;around the world?** &nbsp;The New York Times has been a constant in my life since high school. &nbsp;Whether delivered to my doorstep, on my IPAD or homepage on my computer. &nbsp;I seek out the International edition when travelling overseas. &nbsp;I also love to read the local newspapers—I used to collect newspaper mastheads in cities I visited in the U.S. and internationally. I love the richness of the sound of BBC radio broadcasts, though I miss the ring of Big Ben at the beginning of the show.
